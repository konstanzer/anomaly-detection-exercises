Hello Zach,

I looked at that student logs data. I was successful in finding some answers using a combination of visualizations and z-scores. The information below is identicalto the slide I've attached as a png file. 

1. Which lessons appear to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
Data science: 1. Fundamentals, 2. Classification, 3. Regression
Web development (Java + PHP): 1. Javascript-I, 2. Spring, 3. HTML-CSS
2. Which lessons are least accessed?
Data science: 1. Acquire, 2. Dataframes, 3. Distributed-ML
Web development (Java + PHP): 1. JSP+JSTL, 2. Fundamentals, 3. Web design
3. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts?
Java: Oberon: Javascript-I, Java-I, Neptune: HTML-CSS, Marco: jQuery, Niagara: Spring, Appendix
PHP: Franklin: Java-III, Javascript-II, Hampton: Prework, Java-I, Java-II
4. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
Data science: 1. Fundamentals, 2. Classification
Web development (Java + PHP): 1. Spring, 2. Javascript-I
5. Is there any suspicious activity like scraping? Who are the illicit users/bots accessing the curriculum?
192.171.117.210 is abnormally active throughout log
12.106.208.194 accessed material 3,300 times in three weeks, March 2020

My notebook is available here

Prepare and acquire files can also be found in the repo.

Good luck with your presentation and remember: It's better to burn out than to fade away.
