Hello Zach,

I looked at that student logs data. I was successful in finding some answers.

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
   
   I used the home directory and eliminated folders that didn't look like lessons. These are my best guesses.
   
    * Java Full-Stack: javascript-i
    * PHP Full-Stack: javascript-i
    * Data science: classification and fundamentals tied

2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
4. Is there suspicious activity such as users/machines accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that scraping is happening? one user makes many requests at once Are there any suspicious IPs?
6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?

Good luck on your presentation,
